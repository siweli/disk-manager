# Disk Manager V1

## Reason for existence

This project is because I only have a 500GB SSD on my personal PC and I am always running out of space so I wanted to see what was taking up all the space.
Normal file explorer doesn't show folder size because it makes Windows slow (shocker) and there are likely plenty of programs that offer this functionality.
However, as per usual I saw this as an opportunity to create my own version and this is why it exists.

## Functionality

- Currently just scans the PC from a given start path and gets the 'Size' of the folder (not the actual size on disk).
- A basic user interface similar to File Explorer to navigate the folders and displays the size of each folder.

## Plans for the future

- I would like to make this have the ability to delete folders from the UI as I am currently copying the file path, investigating the folder myself before deleting.
- It would also be nice to have an AI assistant to query if the folder path is safe to delete or not along with where it is possibly from.
